## Switch and manage directories

In the Directories section, you'll see your Current directory (which you're currently signed in to).
To see a full list of directories to which you have access, select All Directories.
To mark a directory as a favorite, select its star icon. Those directories will be listed in the Favorites section.
To switch to a different directory, select the directory that you want to work in, then select the Switch button in its row.

# Find your Azure subscription
Follow these steps to retrieve the ID for a subscription in the Azure portal.

```
1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. Under the Azure services heading, select Subscriptions. 
3. If you don't see Subscriptions here, use the search box to find it.
4. Find the Subscription ID for the subscription shown in the second column. 
5. If no subscriptions appear, or you don't see the right one, you may need to switch directories to show the subscriptions from a different Azure AD tenant.
6. Copy the Subscription ID. You can paste this value into a text document or other location.
```

## Find your Azure AD tenant
Follow these steps to retrieve the ID for an Azure AD tenant in the Azure portal.

```
1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. Confirm that you are signed into the tenant for which you want to retrieve the ID. 
3. If not, switch directories so that you're working in the right tenant.
4. Under the Azure services heading, select Azure Active Directory. If you don't see Azure Active Directory here, use the search box to find it.
5. Find the Tenant ID in the Basic information section of the Overview screen.
6. Copy the Tenant ID. You can paste this value into a text document or other location.
```

## Create a new dashboard

From the Azure portal menu, select Dashboard. Your default view might already be set to dashboard.

Pin content from a resource page
Another way to add tiles to your dashboard is directly from a resource page.

Many resource pages include a pin icon in the page header, which means that you can pin a tile representing the source page. In some cases, a pin icon may also appear by specific content within a page, which means you can pin a tile for that specific content, rather than the entire page.
